`Yisroel Mirsky` is a tenure-track faculty member in the Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering at Ben-Gurion University. He received his Ph.D. from BGU in 2018 and was a postdoctoral fellow for two years in the at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the research labs of Prof. Wenke Lee. His main research interests include deepfakes, adversarial machine learning, anomaly detection, and intrusion detection. Dr. Mirsky has published his work in some of the best security venues: USENIX, CCS, NDSS, Euro S&P, Black Hat, DEF CON, RSA, CSF, AISec, etc. His research has also been featured in many well-known media outlets: *Popular Science, Scientific American, Wired, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes*, and BBC. Some of his works, include the exposure of vulnerabilities in the US 911 emergency services and research into the threat of deepfakes in medical scans, both featured in *The Washington Post*.

A complete CV can be found [here]().

### Grants

Over the years, I have been awarded a number of grants  from a wide variety of institutions. Working with these organizations has been an incredible experience. Thank you for your support!
